This module is responsible for the processing of payloads in k2-connect.
It converts JSON objects to python dictionaries then breaks down the python
dictionaries and sets their values to predefined "names" that correspond to
their respective keys in the JSON object using python properties.
:Example:
    sample_dictionary = {'key': 'value'}
    instance_of_payload_decomposer.key = sample_dictionary['value']

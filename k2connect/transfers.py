This module handles transfer of funds to pre-approved settlement accounts. It creates
verified settlement bank accounts. Once an account to which funds can be settled is available,
it creates blind and targeted settlement transactions.
Blind transfers are made to the default settlement account defined upon k2 customer acquisition,
targeted transfers are made to a defined destination account.
